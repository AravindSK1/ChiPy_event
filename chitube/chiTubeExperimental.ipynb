Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \\\\n\\\\n///\\\\n\\\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\\\\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\\\\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\\\\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\\\\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\\\\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press.'),\n",

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\\\\n\\\\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\\\\n\\\\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\\\\n\\\\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?\"),\n",

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it. Since ‘When I Was Young’ is all about nostalgia and reflecting on life—especially the past, but also the now and the future—it just seemed like the perfect time to do it.”  - MØ\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young EP Out Now:\\\\nRetail: http://smarturl.it/WIWYRet\\\\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WIWYIT\\\\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WIWYAM\\\\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WIWYSP\\\\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/WIWYGP\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young (Lyric Video): http://smarturl.it/WIWYYT\\\\n \\\\nRoots (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RootsYT\\\\nTurn My Heart to Stone (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/TMHTSYT\\\\nLinking With You (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/LWYYT\\\\nBb (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/BbYTB\\\\nRun Away (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RAYT\\\\n \\\\nMØ on Tour with Cashmere Cat: http://smarturl.it/MeowTour\\\\n\\\\nFollow MØ: \\\\nWebsite - http://momomoyouth.com\\\\nFacebook - http://smarturl.it/MOfacebook\\\\nInstagram - http://smarturl.it/MOinstagram\\\\nTwitter - http://smarturl.it/MOtwitter\\\\nMailer - http://smarturl.it/MOmail\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young Lyrics:\\\\n \\\\nWhen the sky was gold\\\\nand I needed no protection\\\\nas the wind would blow\\\\na 1000 miles in no direction\\\\nman it was a beautiful sight\\\\ndays were soaked in sunlight\\\\njust so long ago\\\\nbut lately I like to imagine\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwhatever happened it would do me no wrong\\\\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\\\\nwhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on\\\\nwe were so high\\\\nlet the freeway take us into the night\\\\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\\\\nWhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nwhen I was young\\\\n\\\\nNow the sky is grey\\\\nbut honestly it doesn't hurt me\\\\nI learned to find my way\\\\non the path of no returning\\\\nEverything I've left behind\\\\nI'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes\\\\nwe were so bold and brave\\\\nbaby can you imagine\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwhatever happened it could do me no wrong\\\\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\\\\nwhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on\\\\nwe were so high\\\\nlet the freeway take us into the night\\\\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\\\\nWhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwe would play with fire\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nand we would fuck the price\\\\nwhen I was young\\\\nIt was do or die I would give my life just to feel like\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n \\\\nAnd the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n \\\\nMusic video by MØ performing When I Was Young (C) 2017 Sony Music Recordings, Inc.\"),\n",

I️t will be back up and running soon! \\\\n\\\\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. It’s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesn’t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, it’s just that it’s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes I’m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. I’d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\\\\n\\\\nMusic Used: \\\\nAvocado Street\\\\nGymnopedie No1\\\\nReflection Pool\\\\nLife in Romance\\\\nSimple Story'),\n",

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\\\\n\\\\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/'),\n",

Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \\\\n\\\\n///\\\\n\\\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\\\\n\\\\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\\\\n\\\\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\\\\n\\\\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.  Used with permission.\\\\n\\\\nWe recently shot more photos and video (March 2014) Here is a new video: http://youtu.be/VQ0dRIi9wYs. \\\\n\\\\nHere are more photos to view and maybe purchase as well.http://smu.gs/1hGSRKz.'),\n",

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\\\\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\\\\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\\\\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\\\\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit.

He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\\\\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press.'),\n",

As you see, Face ID has been enabled.\\\\n\\\\nBecause no one stands in front of it, the iPhone asks me to enter the passcode to access it.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I will try unlocking this iPhone with a specially crafted mask. \\\\n\\\\nWoa, as you see, I have successfully unlocked the iPhone X with the mask.\\\\n\\\\nThis iPhone is mine, clearly I can easily unlock it with my face.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, Face ID on this iPhone X is not as secure as Apple has announced. \\\\n\\\\nThank you !\\\\n____________________________________\\\\n\\\\nWebsite Bkav: http://bkav.com\\\\nFacebook Bkav: https://www.facebook.com/BkavCorp\"),\n",

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\\\\n\\\\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\\\\n\\\\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\\\\n\\\\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?\"),\n",

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it. Since ‘When I Was Young’ is all about nostalgia and reflecting on life—especially the past, but also the now and the future—it just seemed like the perfect time to do it.”  - MØ\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young EP Out Now:\\\\nRetail: http://smarturl.it/WIWYRet\\\\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WIWYIT\\\\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WIWYAM\\\\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WIWYSP\\\\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/WIWYGP\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young (Lyric Video): http://smarturl.it/WIWYYT\\\\n \\\\nRoots (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RootsYT\\\\nTurn My Heart to Stone (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/TMHTSYT\\\\nLinking With You (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/LWYYT\\\\nBb (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/BbYTB\\\\nRun Away (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RAYT\\\\n \\\\nMØ on Tour with Cashmere Cat: http://smarturl.it/MeowTour\\\\n\\\\nFollow MØ: \\\\nWebsite - http://momomoyouth.com\\\\nFacebook - http://smarturl.it/MOfacebook\\\\nInstagram - http://smarturl.it/MOinstagram\\\\nTwitter - http://smarturl.it/MOtwitter\\\\nMailer - http://smarturl.it/MOmail\\\\n \\\\nWhen I Was Young Lyrics:\\\\n \\\\nWhen the sky was gold\\\\nand I needed no protection\\\\nas the wind would blow\\\\na 1000 miles in no direction\\\\nman it was a beautiful sight\\\\ndays were soaked in sunlight\\\\njust so long ago\\\\nbut lately I like to imagine\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwhatever happened it would do me no wrong\\\\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\\\\nwhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on\\\\nwe were so high\\\\nlet the freeway take us into the night\\\\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\\\\nWhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nwhen I was young\\\\n\\\\nNow the sky is grey\\\\nbut honestly it doesn't hurt me\\\\nI learned to find my way\\\\non the path of no returning\\\\nEverything I've left behind\\\\nI'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes\\\\nwe were so bold and brave\\\\nbaby can you imagine\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwhatever happened it could do me no wrong\\\\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\\\\nwhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on\\\\nwe were so high\\\\nlet the freeway take us into the night\\\\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\\\\nWhen I was young, oh\\\\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nwe would play with fire\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\nand we would fuck the price\\\\nwhen I was young\\\\nIt was do or die I would give my life just to feel like\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n \\\\nAnd the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\\\\nWhen I was young\\\\n \\\\nMusic video by MØ performing When I Was Young (C) 2017 Sony Music Recordings, Inc.\"),\n",

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\\\\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\\\\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\\\\nAdd two eggs\\\\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\\\\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \\\\n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \\\\n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\\\\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \\\\nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \\\\nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \\\\nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \\\\nReduce it to 350. \\\\nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \\\\nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \\\\nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.'),\n",

We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in.

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\\\\n\\\\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\\\\n\\\\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\\\\n\\\\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\\\\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\\\\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\\\\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\\\\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\\\\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press.'),\n",

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\\\\n\\\\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\\\\n\\\\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\\\\n\\\\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?\"),\n",

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \\\\n\\\\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \\\\n\\\\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \\\\n\\\\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \\\\nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\\\\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\\\\n\\\\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\\\\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.'),\n",

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\\\\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\\\\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\\\\nAdd two eggs\\\\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\\\\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \\\\n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \\\\n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\\\\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \\\\nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \\\\nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \\\\nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \\\\nReduce it to 350. \\\\nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \\\\nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \\\\nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.'),\n",

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\\\\n\\\\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/'),\n",

Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\\\\n\\\\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\\\\n\\\\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?\"),\n",

       "  'On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \\\\n\\\\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\\\\n\\\\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‘Justice League’s Tomatometer Score\\\\n\\\\n-Tarantino’s next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\\\\n\\\\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\\\\n\\\\n-‘Halloween’ Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\\\\n\\\\n-What Women Want remake ‘What Men Want’ in the works at Paramount; Empire’s Taraji P. Henson To Star\\\\n\\\\n-Mail Bag\\\\n\\\\n-Live Twitter Questions\\\\n\\\\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\\\\n\\\\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\\\\n\\\\nBUY OR SELL\\\\n\\\\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \\\\n\\\\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\\\\n\\\\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \\\\n\\\\nMAIL BAG\\\\n\\\\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\\\\n\\\\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\\\\n\\\\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\\\\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\\\\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\\\\n\\\\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\\\\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\\\\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\\\\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\\\\n\\\\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\\\\n\\\\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\\\\n\\\\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\\\\n\\\\nCollider Show Schedule:\\\\n\\\\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \\\\n\\\\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\\\\n\\\\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \\\\n\\\\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \\\\n\\\\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \\\\n\\\\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \\\\n\\\\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \\\\n\\\\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\\\\n\\\\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\\\\n\\\\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO'),\n",

SUBSCRIBE! ►► http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub  \\\\n↓↓↓ More info and sources below ↓↓↓\\\\n\\\\nOrganisms of all shapes and sizes synchronize their behaviors using biological clocks. Some keep pace with the daily rising and setting sun using circadian rhythms. Others use annual cycles or the changing seasons as their cue. But many animals use moonlight and Earth’s lunar cycle to run their biological clock. Do humans do the same thing, with things like menstrual cycles? This week we take a look at living by moonlight.\\\\n\\\\nMenstrual cycle data courtesy of Clue app (https://helloclue.com/)\\\\n\\\\nGrunion footage courtesy of  KQED’s Deep Look (https://www.youtube.com/user/KQEDDeepLook) and Dr. Michael Murrie - Pepperdine University\\\\n\\\\nSOURCES:\\\\n\\\\nThe Myth of the Moon and Menstruation: https://medium.com/clued-in/the-myth-of-the-moon-and-menstruation-f85b151e45c3 \\\\n\\\\nGrant, Rachel, Tim Halliday, and Elizabeth Chadwick.

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\\\\n\\\\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\\\\n\\\\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for watching, Tim\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\\\\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\\\\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\\\\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150\"),\n",

       "  \"The original 4x4 utility vehicle by Jeep.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst manufactured during World War II, it evolved post-war into the civilian Jeep CJ, and inspired both an entire category of recreational 4WDs and several generations of military light utility vehicles.\\\\n\\\\nWhat's your favorite Jeep?  The Willy? The CJ? The Wrangler? Let us know in the comments below! \\\\n\\\\nIt premiered at the World's Fair in 1917 and has evolved into perhaps the most iconic, legendary, and well-known car of all time. It's looked great (Mach 1), bad (Mustang 2), boxy (Foxbody), round (sn-95), and now--arguably--back to great again. \\\\n\\\\nWhat's your favorite Mustang? The classic fastback? The agro notchback?

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \\\\n\\\\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \\\\n\\\\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \\\\n\\\\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \\\\nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\\\\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\\\\n\\\\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\\\\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.'),\n",

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\\\\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\\\\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\\\\nAdd two eggs\\\\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\\\\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \\\\n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \\\\n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\\\\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \\\\nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \\\\nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \\\\nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \\\\nReduce it to 350. \\\\nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \\\\nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \\\\nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.'),\n",

       "  \"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\\\\n\\\\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\\\\n\\\\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\\\\n\\\\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\\\\n\\\\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\\\\n\\\\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?\"),\n",

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\\\\n\\\\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/'),\n",

Some keep pace with the daily rising and setting sun using circadian rhythms. Others use annual cycles or the changing seasons as their cue.

       "  'On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \\\\n\\\\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\\\\n\\\\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‘Justice League’s Tomatometer Score\\\\n\\\\n-Tarantino’s next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\\\\n\\\\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\\\\n\\\\n-‘Halloween’ Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\\\\n\\\\n-What Women Want remake ‘What Men Want’ in the works at Paramount; Empire’s Taraji P. Henson To Star\\\\n\\\\n-Mail Bag\\\\n\\\\n-Live Twitter Questions\\\\n\\\\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\\\\n\\\\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\\\\n\\\\nBUY OR SELL\\\\n\\\\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \\\\n\\\\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\\\\n\\\\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \\\\n\\\\nMAIL BAG\\\\n\\\\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\\\\n\\\\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\\\\n\\\\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\\\\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\\\\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\\\\n\\\\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\\\\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\\\\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\\\\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\\\\n\\\\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\\\\n\\\\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\\\\n\\\\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\\\\n\\\\nCollider Show Schedule:\\\\n\\\\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \\\\n\\\\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\\\\n\\\\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \\\\n\\\\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \\\\n\\\\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \\\\n\\\\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \\\\n\\\\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \\\\n\\\\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\\\\n\\\\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\\\\n\\\\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO'),\n",

Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\\\\n\\\\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\\\\n\\\\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for watching, Tim\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\\\\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\\\\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\\\\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150\"),\n",
